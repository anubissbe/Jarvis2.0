Jarvis: Advanced Bilingual AI Assistant - Technical Design Document
1. Introduction and System Overview
This document outlines the technical design for Jarvis, an advanced bilingual AI assistant. Jarvis is conceived to provide sophisticated interaction capabilities, robust long-term memory, internet-verified information accuracy, and high-performance operation.

1.1. Purpose of Jarvis
The primary purpose of Jarvis is to function as a highly capable, bilingual AI assistant proficient in both English and Dutch. It is designed to handle complex query processing, offer technical assistance, engage in creative tasks, and provide everyday support. A key characteristic of Jarvis is its helpful, friendly, and slightly witty personality, drawing inspiration from the AI persona in "Iron Man," as specified in the foundational requirements. This persona must be consistently maintained across all interactions.

1.2. High-Level Goals and Key Capabilities
Jarvis aims to achieve several high-level goals, underpinned by a set of key capabilities:

Long-Term Memory: The system will possess the ability to remember information from past interactions and integrate user-provided knowledge seamlessly into its conversational context.
Extended Context: Jarvis will be engineered to handle and recall substantial amounts of information within a single, continuous conversation, allowing for coherent and contextually rich dialogues.
Internet-Verified Accuracy: A core function will be the proactive verification of factual information using real-time internet searches, with a strict requirement to cite sources for transparency and reliability.
Bilingual Fluency: Jarvis will automatically detect the language used by the user (English or Dutch) and respond with natural fluency in the detected language, avoiding unnecessary translation cues.
Performance: The system will be optimized for responsiveness and speed, leveraging the specified server hardware to ensure a smooth user experience.
Comprehensive Knowledge Domains: Jarvis's expertise will span technology (programming, system administration, AI/ML), science (physics, chemistry), humanities (history, literature), practical daily tasks, and local knowledge relevant to Belgian and Dutch contexts.
1.3. Core Technology Stack Summary
The realization of Jarvis will depend on a carefully selected and integrated technology stack:

LLM Serving: Ollama will be utilized for serving the local Large Language Model (LLM).   
User Interface & Explicit LTM: OpenWebUI will serve as the primary user interface and will also manage explicit long-term memory through its "Knowledge" workspace features.   
Orchestration & Backend Logic: A Python-based backend, likely utilizing the FastAPI framework for API development, will incorporate LangChain for orchestrating LLM interactions, RAG pipelines, and tool usage.   
Vector Database (Semantic LTM): ChromaDB is selected for storing and retrieving embeddings of conversational data, enabling semantic search for implicit long-term memory.   
Graph Database (Relational LTM): Neo4j will be employed to store and query relationships between entities and concepts extracted from conversations, forming a structured relational long-term memory.   
Internet Search: The Tavily API, or a comparable service, will be integrated via LangChain to provide Jarvis with real-time internet search capabilities.   
Deployment: Docker and Docker Compose will be used for containerizing and orchestrating all system components on the target server infrastructure.   
1.4. Document Scope and Target Audience
This document provides a comprehensive technical design intended for software developers and system architects tasked with the implementation of Jarvis. It covers the system architecture, selection and configuration of components, integration strategies, and deployment procedures. The level of detail aims to be sufficient for direct development and implementation.

A critical consideration throughout Jarvis's design is the holistic integration of all components to ensure not only technical functionality but also consistent adherence to its defined persona and operational guidelines. The user query emphasizes specific behaviors such as "ALWAYS query your connected knowledge base" and "NEVER rely solely on your training data." Achieving this level of consistency requires that the entire system, from the LLM's prompt to the backend logic, actively enforces these rules. The RAG pipeline, internet search module, and error handling mechanisms must all be designed to be persona-aware and to uphold these operational mandates. For instance, the LangChain agent orchestrating responses must be explicitly programmed to trigger knowledge base lookups for factual queries before allowing the LLM to generate a response from its parametric memory. Similarly, internet searches for time-sensitive information must be an indispensable step. While the LLM's system prompt will define its core personality traits like wittiness, the broader system architecture is responsible for ensuring helpfulness, accuracy, and adherence to sourcing protocols.

2. Jarvis Core AI Model: Selection and Configuration
The selection of an appropriate Large Language Model (LLM) is foundational to Jarvis's capabilities. This section details the requirements, evaluation of candidates, the chosen model, and its configuration within the Ollama framework.

2.1. Base LLM Requirements
The base LLM for Jarvis must satisfy several critical requirements:

Extended Context Window: A "huge context" is a specific user requirement, necessitating an LLM capable of processing and recalling information from lengthy conversations and extensive documents.
Bilingual Proficiency (English/Dutch): The model must demonstrate fluent understanding and generation in both English and Dutch, allowing for natural language switching based on user input. Strong performance in Dutch is particularly important.
Performance on NVIDIA V100 GPUs: The LLM must operate efficiently on the target hardware, which consists of two NVIDIA V100 GPUs, each with 16GB of VRAM. This consideration influences the choice of model size and the necessity of quantization.
Instruction Following: Excellent instruction-following capabilities are crucial for Jarvis to adhere to the detailed operational guidelines and persona attributes defined in the user's prompt.
Open Source & Ollama Compatibility: The model must be open source and compatible with Ollama for local deployment.
2.2. Evaluation of Candidate Models
Several open-source LLMs were evaluated based on the above requirements. The following table summarizes the comparison of the leading candidates:

Model Name	Parameters	Quantized Size (Q5_K_M GGUF Est.)	Max Context Length (Tokens)	Explicit Dutch Support	Key Strengths for Jarvis	Potential V100 Fit/Performance Notes
Llama 3.1 8B Instruct	8B	~5.7 GB	128,000 	Yes (via broad multilingual training including German, French) 	Large context, strong multilingualism, good instruction following, good balance of capability and size.	Good fit for 16GB V100 with Q5_K_M. Allows significant VRAM for context. Good performance expected.
Qwen2.5 7B Instruct	7B	~4.7 GB 	128,000 	Yes (via broad multilingual training) 	Large context, good multilingual support, strong instruction following, very efficient.	Excellent fit for 16GB V100. Maximizes VRAM for context and parallelism. Very good performance expected.
Qwen2.5 14B Instruct	14B	~8.9 GB (Q4_K_M) 	128,000 	Yes (via broad multilingual training) 	Potentially higher capability than 7B/8B models, large context.	Feasible on 16GB V100 with Q4_K_M, but leaves less VRAM for context compared to 7B/8B models. Performance good but potentially slower than smaller models.
Fietje 2B Chat	2.8B	~2.0 GB	(Not specified, likely smaller)	Yes (Dutch-specific) 	Excellent Dutch, very lightweight.	Very fast on V100, but may lack general reasoning and English fluency compared to larger multilingual models.  notes multilingual models are competitive.
  
Analysis of Candidates:

Llama 3.1 8B: Offers a compelling combination of a very large context window (128k tokens ), robust multilingual capabilities (including support for languages linguistically related to Dutch, enhancing its Dutch performance ), and a parameter size suitable for the V100 GPUs when quantized. Its instruction-following capabilities are well-regarded. GGUF versions are readily available for Ollama.   
Qwen2.5 (7B or 14B): These models also provide extensive multilingual support and a 128K token context window. The 7B version (approx. 4.7GB ) fits very comfortably on a V100, while the 14B version (approx. 8-9GB with Q4_K_M quantization ) is also feasible, potentially offering enhanced capabilities if VRAM constraints for context can be managed. Ollama-compatible GGUF versions are available. Benchmarks indicate strong quality and performance.   
Fietje 2B/GEITje 7B: Fietje is specifically optimized for Dutch. While this ensures strong Dutch performance, Jarvis requires equally strong English capabilities and seamless bilingual switching. Broader multilingual models like Llama 3.1 or Qwen2.5 may offer a better balance for this dual-language requirement, a trend acknowledged even by Fietje's developers. The smaller size of Fietje would yield high performance but might compromise on the breadth of general reasoning.   
Mistral 7B: Known for its efficiency and strong performance for its size , Mistral 7B is a viable option for V100 deployment. However, its out-of-the-box Dutch capabilities might not be as explicitly tuned or as extensive as those of Llama 3.1 or Qwen2.5, which benefit from more recent and broader multilingual training datasets.   
2.3. Selected Base Model and Rationale
Based on the evaluation, the following selection is made:

Primary Recommendation: Llama 3.1 8B Instruct (GGUF, e.g., q5_k_m quantization).
Rationale: This model provides an optimal balance of features for Jarvis. Its 128k token context window directly addresses the "huge context" requirement. Its multilingual training, explicitly including languages like German and French, suggests strong underlying capabilities for handling Dutch effectively alongside English. The 8-billion parameter size, when appropriately quantized, is well-suited for the 16GB VRAM of the NVIDIA V100 GPUs, allowing sufficient headroom for the context cache and ensuring good performance. The "Instruct" variant is crucial for enabling the model to follow the complex operational guidelines and persona defined for Jarvis.   
Secondary Recommendation: Qwen2.5 7B Instruct (GGUF, e.g., q5_k_m quantization).
Rationale: Should the Llama 3.1 8B model prove too resource-intensive in practice, or if initial testing reveals a more favorable English/Dutch performance balance with Qwen2.5, the 7B variant of Qwen2.5 serves as a robust alternative. It also features a 128K context window and comprehensive multilingual support. Its smaller footprint would guarantee faster inference speeds and provide more VRAM for context and parallel request processing.   
The choice between these will ultimately be confirmed by empirical testing on the target hardware, focusing on achieving the largest possible effective context window while maintaining desired inference speeds. The hardware specification (2x V100 16GB GPUs) necessitates careful consideration of model size versus available VRAM for context. While Ollama can distribute larger models across GPUs , a more efficient approach for Jarvis, given the desire for a large context and good speed, is to run a capable model that fits comfortably on a single GPU, leaving ample VRAM for the KV cache (which stores the context). An 8B model like Llama 3.1, quantized to around 5-6GB, leaves substantial VRAM on a 16GB card for a large num_ctx. This is often preferable to a larger model that consumes most of the VRAM for weights alone, thereby limiting the practical context size or forcing slower processing due to memory pressure. The second V100 can then be used to run another instance of the same model for load balancing or handling more concurrent users.   

2.4. Ollama Modelfile for Jarvis
The Ollama Modelfile is a cornerstone for defining Jarvis's core behavior, personality, and operational parameters. The following structure is proposed:   

Codefragment

FROM llama-3.1-8b-instruct:q5_k_m  # Or the selected GGUF model variant

# Parameters for context length, temperature, etc.
PARAMETER num_ctx 65536 # Start with a large value, e.g., 64k tokens. Adjust based on VRAM and performance testing. Max is 131072 for Llama 3.1.
PARAMETER temperature 0.7
PARAMETER top_p 0.9
PARAMETER top_k 40
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1
# Add other parameters as needed, e.g., stop sequences if required by the persona's interaction style.

# System prompt defining Jarvis's persona and operational guidelines

"""
The PARAMETER num_ctx value is critical for achieving the "huge context" capability and should be set as high as possible while ensuring stable operation and acceptable performance on the V100 GPUs. The extensive system prompt provided by the user is directly embedded, as this is the most effective way to instill the desired persona and operational rules into the LLM's behavior.   

2.5. Quantization Strategy (GGUF)
The GGUF format is standard for running LLMs efficiently on local hardware using frameworks like Ollama and llama.cpp. Quantization reduces the model's numerical precision, leading to smaller file sizes and lower VRAM requirements, which in turn enables larger models to run on existing hardware and often speeds up inference.   

Strategy: A quantization level such as Q5_K_M or Q4_K_M is recommended. These levels typically offer a favorable trade-off between model performance (speed and size reduction) and potential accuracy degradation. For an 8B parameter model on a 16GB V100 GPU, a Q5_K_M quantization (resulting in a model size of approximately 5.7GB for Llama 3 8B, or similar for other 8B models) is a good starting point. If a 14B model like Qwen2.5 14B is considered, a Q4_K_M quantization (resulting in a model size of around 8-9GB ) would be necessary to fit within the VRAM, leaving adequate space for the context KV cache.   
Hardware Compatibility: The NVIDIA V100 GPUs support Float16 (FP16) precision , which is well-aligned with GGUF model operations and ensures efficient execution. While GGUF models can run on CPUs, GPU acceleration is indispensable for meeting Jarvis's performance requirements. The V100 is primarily suited for inference workloads rather than extensive training of large models.   
The selection of quantization level will be fine-tuned during initial performance testing to maximize context length and inference speed without unacceptable loss of response quality.

3. Long-Term Memory (LTM) Architecture
Jarvis's long-term memory (LTM) is designed as a hybrid system, integrating explicit, user-provided knowledge with implicit memories automatically captured from conversational interactions. This multifaceted approach aims to provide Jarvis with a persistent and evolving understanding of users, topics, and past dialogues, aligning with established patterns for AI agent memory.   

The LTM system will comprise three main storage mechanisms, each serving a distinct purpose but working in concert:

LTM Type	Storage Mechanism	Data Stored	Primary Use Case for Jarvis	Population Method
Explicit Factual/Documentary	OpenWebUI Knowledge (Internal ChromaDB)	User-uploaded documents (PDFs, Markdown files, text, etc.) 	Answering questions based on specific provided documents, manuals, notes.	Manual upload by user via OpenWebUI interface.
Implicit Semantic	Custom ChromaDB Instance	Summaries of conversation turns, extracted salient facts, user preferences, important statements.	Recalling specific details, preferences, or summaries from past conversations via semantic similarity search.	Automatic, asynchronous extraction and summarization from conversation history by the Python backend.
Implicit Relational	Custom Neo4j Instance	Entities (users, projects, topics), relationships between entities, links between conversation turns and mentioned entities/facts.	Understanding complex relationships, historical context, and patterns in user interactions over time through graph traversal and queries.	Automatic, asynchronous extraction of entities and relationships from conversation history by the Python backend.
  
3.1. Conceptual LTM Framework
The LTM framework is designed to provide Jarvis with a persistent, evolving memory.

Explicit Knowledge (Semantic/Factual): This layer consists of documents and structured information that users explicitly provide to Jarvis. It is managed through OpenWebUI's "Knowledge" feature. This forms a curated, authoritative knowledge base that Jarvis can directly reference.   
Implicit Conversational Memory (Episodic/Semantic): This layer captures key information derived automatically from Jarvis's interactions with users. This includes:
Vector Store (ChromaDB): Used for storing embeddings of conversation segments, summaries of turns, or extracted factual statements. This enables fast retrieval based on semantic similarity, allowing Jarvis to "remember" the gist of past discussions or specific important points.   
Graph Database (Neo4j): Employed to model and store the relationships between various entities (e.g., users, projects, topics discussed), concepts, and conversational events. This allows for more nuanced contextual understanding by traversing these relationships, complementing the semantic search capabilities of the vector store.   
A significant consideration is the interplay between OpenWebUI's native knowledge management and the custom LTM components. OpenWebUI's "Knowledge" feature, which uses an internal ChromaDB instance , is primarily for user-curated, explicit documents. The custom ChromaDB and Neo4j instances are for system-captured, implicit memories derived from conversations. However, conversations will inevitably refer to or discuss the content of documents within OpenWebUI's explicit knowledge base. For example, a user might upload "Project_Omega_Specification.pdf" to OpenWebUI Knowledge. Jarvis might then use RAG on this document to answer a direct question. If the user subsequently states, "For Project Omega, the deadline is now next Friday," this new piece of information, not present in the original PDF, must be captured by the implicit LTM. The system should store this preference in the custom ChromaDB for semantic recall and in Neo4j, potentially linking this new fact (Entity: Project Omega Deadline) to the user and to an entity representing "Project Omega," which itself might be linked to the "Project_Omega_Specification.pdf" document. To achieve this linkage, the backend system populating the custom LTM needs a mechanism to be aware of the documents managed by OpenWebUI. This could involve OpenWebUI exposing an API to list its knowledge items or, if architecturally feasible and secure, allowing the backend read-access to OpenWebUI's internal ChromaDB. A simpler, more decoupled approach would be for the implicit LTM to merely record that "User discussed Document X (known to be in OpenWebUI knowledge)" and store related conversational facts or preferences, relying on the user or Jarvis to make the explicit connection to the document content during subsequent interactions.   

3.2. OpenWebUI Knowledge Base for Explicit LTM
OpenWebUI's "Knowledge" feature provides a user-friendly way to create and manage explicit knowledge bases. Users can upload various document types (e.g., Markdown files, PDFs), which OpenWebUI then processes for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).   

Functionality: Within OpenWebUI, users can create distinct "Knowledge Bases" within their workspaces. Documents uploaded to these knowledge bases are then made accessible to custom models.
Underlying Mechanism: OpenWebUI internally utilizes a ChromaDB instance for its RAG capabilities. When documents are uploaded, they are chunked, converted into embeddings, and stored in this internal vector database.   
Jarvis Usage: The Jarvis model, when configured within OpenWebUI, will be linked to these user-created knowledge bases as a "Knowledge Source". This allows Jarvis to directly query and incorporate information from these uploaded documents into its responses.   
Data Flow:
User uploads a document (e.g., project_brief.pdf) to a knowledge base in their OpenWebUI workspace.
OpenWebUI processes the document (chunks, generates embeddings) and stores it in its internal ChromaDB.
When the user interacts with Jarvis and asks a question relevant to project_brief.pdf, OpenWebUI's RAG system retrieves relevant chunks from its ChromaDB and includes them in the prompt sent to the Ollama-served Jarvis LLM.
3.3. Vector Database (ChromaDB) for Implicit Semantic LTM
A dedicated, custom ChromaDB instance will be used to store implicit semantic memories extracted from conversations. This allows Jarvis to recall past statements, user preferences, and summaries of discussions based on their meaning.

Purpose: To enable fast semantic retrieval of important information from previous interactions, augmenting Jarvis's ability to maintain context and personalize responses over longer periods.
Schema/Structure:
A primary collection, for instance, named jarvis_implicit_ltm.
Documents: These will be textual representations of memories, such as:
"User [user_id] expressed a preference for [preference_details] regarding [topic]."
"Key takeaway from conversation with User [user_id] on [date]: [summary_of_discussion]."
"User [user_id] mentioned working on [project_name] with a deadline of [date]."
Embeddings: Generated from the textual content of the documents using a sentence transformer model consistent with that used for querying.
Metadata: Each document will be associated with a rich set of metadata to facilitate precise filtering and contextual retrieval :   
user_id: A unique identifier for the user.
session_id: A unique identifier for the specific conversation session.
timestamp: ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the memory was recorded.
turn_id: A sequential identifier for the conversational turn from which the memory was derived.
memory_type: A categorical tag (e.g., "user_preference", "stated_fact", "task_info", "project_update", "conversation_summary", "clarification_provided").
source_interaction_ids: (Optional) A list of turn IDs from the original conversation that contributed to this memory.
language: The detected language of the source interaction (e.g., "en", "nl").
importance_score: (Optional) A numerical score (e.g., 1-5) indicating the assessed importance of the memory, potentially assigned by an LLM during extraction.
Integration: The Python backend, using LangChain, will be responsible for:
Processing conversation turns.
Generating concise summaries or extracting key factual statements.
Generating embeddings for these memory documents.
Storing these documents along with their embeddings and metadata into the custom ChromaDB instance.
Querying: When Jarvis needs to access this implicit LTM, the backend will formulate a semantic query based on the current conversational context. This query will be used to search the ChromaDB instance, typically filtering by user_id and potentially session_id, language, or memory_type to narrow down relevant memories before performing the vector similarity search. LangChain's Chroma vector store integration supports these operations.   
Docker Deployment: The custom ChromaDB instance will be deployed as a Docker container, configured with a persistent volume to ensure data durability.   
3.4. Graph Database (Neo4j) for Implicit Relational LTM
To capture and utilize the complex web of relationships between entities, concepts, and conversational events, a Neo4j graph database will form the relational backbone of Jarvis's implicit LTM. This complements the vector database by enabling structured, multi-hop queries and providing a richer contextual understanding that goes beyond semantic similarity.   

Purpose: To model how different pieces of information connect over time and across conversations, allowing Jarvis to reason about relationships (e.g., user's involvement in projects, evolution of a topic, connections between different users if applicable in a multi-user context).
Schema/Structure (Conceptual): Inspired by models like the one described in , the graph will consist of nodes and relationships:   
Nodes:
User (userId: STRING, namePreference: STRING, creationTimestamp: DATETIME)
Session (sessionId: STRING, userId: STRING, startTime: DATETIME, endTime: DATETIME, detectedLanguage: STRING)
Turn (turnId: STRING, sessionId: STRING, timestamp: DATETIME, speaker: STRING {USER, JARVIS}, rawText: STRING, summaryId: STRING, language: STRING)
Entity (entityId: STRING, name: STRING, type: STRING {PROJECT, PERSON, TOPIC, ORGANIZATION, TECHNOLOGY, PREFERENCE, LOCATION, DATE_TIME}, normalizedName: STRING)
Fact (factId: STRING, statement: STRING, sourceTurnId: STRING, confidenceScore: FLOAT)
KnowledgeDocument (documentId: STRING, name: STRING, source: STRING {OPENWEBUI_KB, INTERNET_SOURCE}, uri: STRING, lastAccessed: DATETIME) (To link conversations to explicit knowledge)
Relationships:
(User)-->(Session)
(Session)-->(Turn)
(Turn)-->(Entity)
(Turn)-->(Fact)
(User)-->(Entity {type: "PREFERENCE"})
(Entity)-->(Entity) (e.g., (ProjectX)-->(PersonY), (TopicA)-->(TopicB))
(Fact)-->(Entity)
(Turn)-->(KnowledgeDocument)
Integration: The Python backend, leveraging LangChain, will perform NLP tasks (NER, relation extraction) on conversation data to identify entities and their relationships. These will then be translated into Cypher statements to create or update nodes and relationships in Neo4j. LangChain's LLMGraphTransformer can be employed to automate the extraction of graph structures from text.   
Querying: Jarvis will query this graph LTM to retrieve context that requires understanding relationships. For example:
"What were the key decisions made regarding Project X in my previous sessions?"
"Who else was mentioned when we discussed the Python library Y?"
LangChain's Neo4jGraph object and the GraphCypherQAChain can facilitate querying the graph using natural language prompts or by executing specific Cypher queries generated by the backend.   
Docker Deployment: Neo4j will be deployed as a Docker container with persistent volumes for data, logs, and configurations.   
3.5. Automatic LTM Population from Conversations (The "Auto Detect" Feature)
A core requirement is for Jarvis to "auto detect things and add it without user interaction in the long term memory." This necessitates an automated pipeline for processing conversations and populating both the ChromaDB and Neo4j LTM stores.

Process Flow: This process will ideally run asynchronously after each conversational exchange to avoid impacting response latency.
Language Detection: The language of each user message and Jarvis response is detected (e.g., using lingua-py by the backend) and stored with the turn.
Salient Information Extraction: The backend's LTM population module (potentially a LangChain agent or a series of LLM calls) processes the latest conversational turn(s):
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies key entities such as persons, projects, organizations, locations, dates, specific technologies, product names, etc..   
Relation Extraction: Determines relationships between the identified entities (e.g., "User X works on Project Y," "Technology A is part of System B").   
Fact Extraction & Summarization: Extracts key factual statements, decisions made, user preferences explicitly stated, or tasks assigned. Alternatively, it can generate a concise summary of the turn or a short segment of the conversation. LangChain's summarization chains can be utilized for this.   
Coreference Resolution: Resolves pronouns and other anaphoric expressions to their specific entity referents to ensure clarity in extracted information.
Structuring for Storage: The extracted information is then transformed into the appropriate format for each LTM store:
For ChromaDB: Concise factual statements or summaries are created as "documents." Relevant metadata (e.g., user_id, session_id, timestamp, memory_type such as "user_stated_fact" or "project_milestone", language, source_turn_id) is attached.
For Neo4j: Extracted entities become nodes, and relationships become edges, conforming to the predefined graph schema. Attributes of nodes and relationships are populated from the extracted details. LangChain's LLMGraphTransformer can be prompted with specific instructions to output graph structures (nodes with properties, relationships with properties) from text.   
Storage Operation:
The textual documents for ChromaDB are embedded, and then the documents, embeddings, and metadata are written to the jarvis_implicit_ltm collection, likely in batches.
The nodes and relationships are written to Neo4j using Cypher queries (e.g., MERGE statements to create or update entities and relationships).
LangChain Components for Automation:
LangChain agents or custom chains incorporating LLM calls (via Ollama) will perform the NER, relation extraction, and summarization tasks.
The LLMGraphTransformer is a key component for directly converting text into graph structures suitable for Neo4j.   
LangChain callbacks, such as on_chain_end or on_llm_end associated with the main conversational response generation, can be used to trigger this LTM population process asynchronously. This ensures that the user receives Jarvis's response promptly, while memory consolidation happens in the background.   
Trigger Mechanism: For true "auto-detect" functionality, this LTM population process should ideally be triggered after each significant conversational exchange (e.g., after Jarvis provides a response to a user query). Batching updates (e.g., every few turns or at the end of a session) is an alternative to balance immediacy with computational overhead, but per-turn asynchronous processing aligns better with the "auto-detect" requirement.
4. Context Management and Augmentation
Effective context management is paramount for Jarvis to maintain coherent conversations, leverage its long-term memory, and provide relevant responses. This involves maximizing the usable context window of the LLM and implementing a robust Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

4.1. Maximizing Context Window with Chosen LLM and Ollama
The chosen base LLM, Llama 3.1 8B, supports a substantial context window of up to 128,000 tokens. To harness this capability:   

Ollama Modelfile Configuration: The PARAMETER num_ctx in Jarvis's Ollama Modelfile will be set to a high value (e.g., starting at 32768 or 65536, and potentially up to 131072). The optimal value will be determined through empirical testing on the dual NVIDIA V100 16GB GPUs, balancing the desire for maximum context against available VRAM after the model weights are loaded. Each V100's 16GB VRAM must accommodate both the LLM weights (approx. 5.7GB for a Q5_K_M quantized 8B model) and the KV cache, which scales with num_ctx. Benchmarks suggest that an 8B model on a V100 should leave considerable room for a large context cache.   
VRAM Management: The strategy is to maximize num_ctx on each GPU running an Ollama instance, ensuring that the model and its KV cache fit entirely within GPU memory to prevent performance degradation from swapping to system RAM.
4.2. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline
The RAG pipeline is central to Jarvis's ability to ground its responses in factual data, thereby enhancing accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and fulfilling the user's requirements for information sourcing. LangChain will serve as the framework for constructing and orchestrating this pipeline.   

Purpose: To dynamically retrieve relevant information from Jarvis's diverse LTM stores (OpenWebUI explicit knowledge, custom ChromaDB for implicit semantic memory, Neo4j for implicit relational memory) and fresh internet search results. This retrieved context is then provided to the LLM along with the user's query to generate an informed response.
Orchestration: The Python backend will manage the RAG flow using LangChain components.
Steps in the RAG Flow:
Query Analysis/Rewriting (Optional but Recommended): The initial user query may undergo a preliminary processing step. An LLM call can be used to rephrase the query for optimal retrieval, potentially by making it more specific, resolving ambiguities, or incorporating context from recent turns in the conversation history. LangChain offers functionalities for such query transformation.   
Parallel Information Retrieval: The system will concurrently query multiple information sources:
LTM - OpenWebUI Knowledge (Explicit): If the Jarvis model in OpenWebUI is configured with a "Knowledge Source," OpenWebUI's internal RAG system (using its ChromaDB ) will retrieve relevant document chunks. For more granular control or if the backend needs to directly access this knowledge, an API or direct query mechanism to OpenWebUI's knowledge store would be necessary.   
LTM - Implicit Semantic (Custom ChromaDB): The backend will query the custom ChromaDB instance for relevant past conversation summaries, extracted facts, or user preferences. This involves generating an embedding for the current query (or a rephrased version) and performing a similarity search, filtered by metadata like user_id, session_id, and potentially language or memory_type. LangChain's ChromaDB vector store integration will manage this.   
LTM - Implicit Relational (Neo4j): The backend will query the Neo4j graph database for entities, relationships, and historical context relevant to the user's query. This can involve executing specific Cypher queries (potentially generated by an LLM using LangChain's GraphCypherQAChain) or predefined graph traversals.   
Internet Search (Conditional): If the query is identified as factual, time-sensitive, pertaining to recent events, or if verification is explicitly requested, the internet search module will be triggered (details in Section 5).
Context Aggregation, Ranking, and Filtering: Information retrieved from all sources is collected. This context is then ranked based on relevance to the query (e.g., using similarity scores from vector search, confidence scores from graph queries). Duplicate information is removed, and the most pertinent pieces are selected.
Prompt Formulation for LLM: A final, comprehensive prompt is constructed for Jarvis's core LLM. This prompt will include:
The original (or rephrased) user query.
The aggregated, ranked, and filtered context retrieved from LTM and internet searches.
Relevant segments of the current conversation history (as determined by the context management strategy, see Section 4.3).
The overarching Jarvis system prompt (defined in the Ollama Modelfile, which sets the persona, capabilities, and operational rules).
LLM Generation via Ollama: The formulated prompt is sent to one of the Ollama instances serving the Jarvis LLM.
Response Post-processing: The raw response from the LLM is received by the backend. This stage involves extracting the primary answer and identifying and formatting any source citations that the LLM was instructed to include (details in Section 5.4).
While a "huge context" is a design goal, simply concatenating the entire raw chat history with all retrieved RAG documents into the LLM's num_ctx for every turn can be counterproductive. Such an approach might exceed even large context windows like 128k tokens, or it could lead to the LLM "losing focus" on the most critical pieces of information (an issue sometimes referred to as "lost in the middle"). Consequently, a more nuanced, multi-stage context strategy is necessary. The full conversation history is maintained by the backend system. For each new user query, the backend must intelligently distill or select the most relevant portions of this history, combine them with the most relevant RAG-retrieved documents, and then feed this curated context into the LLM's finite num_ctx. This involves using the current query to retrieve pertinent snippets from the complete chat history, summarizing lengthy retrieved documents or historical conversation segments if necessary, ranking all context pieces by relevance, and then carefully packing the most critical information into the LLM's prompt, respecting its context length budget. This "context constructor" component within the RAG pipeline is vital for efficiency and response quality.

4.3. Managing Conversational History for Context
Jarvis needs to effectively manage conversational history at different levels:

Immediate Short-Term Context: This is handled directly by the LLM's configured num_ctx (e.g., 65,536 tokens). The LLM can directly reference information within this window.
Session-Level Medium-Term Context (for RAG & LTM Population): The Python backend will maintain the complete chat history for the current user session. This full history serves several purposes:
Query Augmentation for RAG: It can be used to rephrase or add context to the user's current query before it's sent to the LTM retrieval components. For instance, a follow-up question like "What about its performance?" can be expanded to "What about Project Alpha's performance?" using the preceding conversation.   
Input for LTM Population: The recent turns provide the raw material for the asynchronous LTM population process (summarization, fact/entity extraction for ChromaDB and Neo4j).
Few-Shot Examples: Segments of the history could potentially be used as few-shot examples for specific LLM tasks if needed, although the primary reliance is on the system prompt and RAG.
Long-Term Context (via LTM): Summaries, key facts, and relational data extracted from past sessions are stored in ChromaDB and Neo4j, making them accessible across different sessions.
LangChain and OpenWebUI Roles: LangChain provides tools like ConversationBufferMemory or allows for custom chat message history management. OpenWebUI also displays the chat history to the user and typically sends it with each request to the backend. The backend's role is to intelligently decide how much of this incoming history from OpenWebUI is passed directly to the LLM's num_ctx versus how much is used to inform the RAG retrieval process or summarized for LTM. The goal is to avoid redundant information in the LLM prompt if the same information is already being provided via the RAG context.   
5. Information Retrieval and Verification Engine
A cornerstone of Jarvis's design is its commitment to accuracy and up-to-date information, as mandated by the user requirements: "ALWAYS check internet sources to ensure your information is up-to-date" for time-sensitive data and "Never rely solely on your training data for factual responses that might change over time." This necessitates a robust internet search and verification engine.

5.1. Internet Search Integration
To fulfill the requirement for current information, Jarvis will be equipped with internet search capabilities.

Tool Selection: The Tavily Search API is recommended due to its design for LLM and RAG applications, offering functionalities like context generation, direct question answering, and raw content extraction from URLs. Alternatives such as the Google Search API or SerpAPI can also be integrated using LangChain's tool ecosystem.   
LangChain Integration: The chosen search API will be integrated as a LangChain tool. For Tavily, the TavilySearchResults tool is readily available and can be invoked by a LangChain agent or directly within a chain.   
Trigger Conditions for Internet Search: The Python backend will programmatically decide when an internet search is necessary. This decision will be based on:
Query Keywords: Presence of terms like "latest," "recent," "current," "news," "today," or specific topics known to change rapidly (e.g., stock prices, software versions, political developments).
Factual Nature of Query: If a query asks for a specific fact that is not adequately or confidently answered by the LTM.
LTM Verification: As a mandatory verification step for factual information retrieved from LTM if the information is tagged as potentially outdated or if the user explicitly requests up-to-date information.
User Prompt Mandate: The system prompt for Jarvis explicitly states: "For time-sensitive information or recent events, ALWAYS check internet sources..." and "For queries where information may change rapidly (news, technology, markets), always preface your response with a verification step."
5.2. Process for Verifying Factual Claims and Time-Sensitive Information
Jarvis will follow a structured process for information verification:

Prioritize LTM (Knowledge Base First): In line with the directive "ALWAYS query your connected knowledge base... before responding to factual questions," the RAG pipeline will first attempt to answer the query using information from OpenWebUI Knowledge, custom ChromaDB, and Neo4j.
Initiate Verification (Conditional):
If the LTM provides a factual answer but the topic is flagged as time-sensitive (e.g., based on keywords, topic category, or recency of LTM data).
If the user's query explicitly requests the latest information or verification.
If the LTM yields no answer or an answer with low confidence for a factual query. An internet search will be initiated. The search query can be the original user query, the fact retrieved from LTM that needs verification, or a rephrased query optimized for web search.
Execute Internet Search and Analyze Results: The integrated search tool (e.g., Tavily) will retrieve relevant web pages, snippets, and source URLs.
Cross-Reference and Synthesize: The information retrieved from the internet will be compared with any information found in the LTM.
Consistent Information: If LTM and recent internet sources provide consistent information, Jarvis can use either, prioritizing the most detailed, recent, and authoritatively sourced version.
Conflicting Information: If LTM and internet sources conflict, or if different internet sources offer conflicting views, Jarvis will adhere to the guideline: "When encountering conflicting information, present multiple perspectives with their respective sources."
Outdated LTM: If LTM information is found to be outdated by more current internet sources, the verified internet information will be prioritized for the response.
Potential LTM Update (Feedback Loop): If the verification process uncovers new, reliable information that significantly updates or corrects existing LTM entries, this discrepancy should be flagged. The LTM population mechanism (Section 3.5) could then be triggered to update the LTM with the new, verified information, ensuring Jarvis's knowledge base evolves.
A crucial aspect of robust verification is to avoid relying on a single internet search result. True verification often requires consulting multiple distinct sources. The system should aim to retrieve information from several top-ranking and diverse web sources. The LLM can then be tasked with synthesizing a verified answer based on this multi-source context, explicitly highlighting any consensus or discrepancies found, and attributing claims to their respective sources. This leverages the LLM's analytical capabilities for a more thorough verification than simply accepting the first search hit. The Jarvis prompt already supports this by stating, "When encountering conflicting information, present multiple perspectives with their respective sources."

5.3. Summarizing and Incorporating Search Results into LLM Context
Raw internet search results, which can range from short snippets to entire web pages, are often too verbose or unstructured for direct inclusion in the LLM's prompt.

Summarization with LangChain: LangChain's summarization chains (load_summarize_chain) will be employed to condense the content of retrieved web pages or a collection of search snippets into a concise summary relevant to the query. Different summarization strategies like stuff (for shorter content that fits context), map_reduce (for parallel processing of chunks of longer content), or refine (for iterative improvement of summaries) can be chosen based on the length and complexity of the source material.   
Tavily's Contextual Search: The Tavily API offers a get_search_context method that can provide an initial summarized context from search results, which can be a good starting point. For deeper analysis of specific pages, tavily_client.extract can retrieve the raw content, which is then passed to a LangChain summarization chain.   
Contextual Inclusion: The generated summary, along with prominent source URLs and their access dates, will be incorporated into the aggregated context fed to Jarvis's LLM for final response generation.
5.4. Source Citation Mechanism
Clear and accurate source citation is a non-negotiable requirement for Jarvis.

Requirement Fulfillment: "When providing factual information, include the source and recency of the data when available." "Indicate when information comes from your knowledge base versus internet searches."
Implementation Strategy:
Source Tracking: Throughout the RAG pipeline, the backend system must meticulously track the origin of each piece of information. This includes:
For OpenWebUI Knowledge: Document name, original file path (if available).
For Custom ChromaDB LTM: Metadata fields like memory_type, source_interaction_ids, timestamp.
For Neo4j LTM: Node/relationship properties indicating origin (e.g., derived from Turn node's rawText or Fact node's statement).
For Internet Search: Source URL, website name, access date.
Passing Source Information to LLM: When constructing the prompt for the LLM, identifiers or concise descriptions of the sources must be included alongside the contextual information derived from them. A structured approach, as demonstrated in , involves formatting the context with unique source IDs (e.g., "Source ID: 1, Content:...", "Source ID: 2, Content:...").   
Instructing LLM for Citation: The Jarvis system prompt (in the Ollama Modelfile) and potentially specific instructions within the RAG prompt template must explicitly direct the LLM to cite the specific sources that justify the factual claims in its answer. LangChain's structured output capabilities (e.g., withStructuredOutput using a Pydantic model or Zod schema) can be used to compel the LLM to return not only the answer but also a list of the source IDs it used.   
Formatting and Presenting Citations: The backend will receive the LLM's response, including the cited source IDs. It will then map these IDs back to the full source details (e.g., document name, URL, type of source) and format them for clear presentation in the OpenWebUI. Examples:
"According to (Knowledge Base),..."
"A recent report from [Website Name] (, Internet Search, accessed DD-MM-YYYY) states that..."
"Based on our previous discussion on (Conversation History), you mentioned..." The method described in , where a function like formatDocsWithId prepares context with source IDs for the LLM, and the LLM is constrained to output cited source IDs, provides a robust template for this mechanism.   
6. Performance, Scalability, and Hardware Optimization
Achieving "good performance speed" for Jarvis on the specified HP Proliant G10 server with dual NVIDIA V100 GPUs is a primary objective. This section details strategies for optimizing LLM inference, database operations, caching, and considerations for future scalability.

The server hardware comprises dual Xeon Gold 6128 CPUs (totaling 24 physical cores/48 threads @ 3.40GHz), 256 GB RAM, 10 TB storage, and two NVIDIA V100 GPUs, each with 16GB HBM2 VRAM. The V100 GPU features the Volta architecture, 5,120 CUDA cores, 640 Tensor Cores, and delivers approximately 14 TFLOPS of FP32 performance.   

6.1. Optimizing LLM Inference on Dual NVIDIA V100 GPUs with Ollama
Effective utilization of the dual V100 GPUs is key to Jarvis's responsiveness.

Ollama GPU Configuration Strategy:
Configuration Aspect	Recommended Setting/Strategy for 2xV100	Rationale	Key Ollama Variable(s) / Docker Config
Model Instance per GPU	One primary Jarvis LLM instance per GPU.	Maximizes VRAM per instance for model weights and large context KV cache. An 8B model (~6GB quantized) fits comfortably.	Define two separate Ollama services in Docker Compose.
GPU Assignment	Assign each Ollama instance exclusively to one V100.	Prevents resource contention between instances and ensures dedicated GPU resources for each.	CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 for ollama1, CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 for ollama2 in Docker Compose environment settings.
Parallel Requests per Instance	OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=2 to 4 (per instance, test for optimal).	Allows each Ollama instance to handle a few concurrent requests using shared model weights but separate KV caches, improving throughput. Value depends on num_ctx and remaining VRAM.	OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL environment variable.
Context Size (num_ctx)	Maximize per instance (e.g., 32768 to 131072, test vigorously).	Leverages large VRAM headroom after loading an 8B model for "huge context" capability.	PARAMETER num_ctx in Modelfile.
Model Spreading	Generally disable for 8B model on 16GB VRAM.	Spreading an 8B model is unnecessary and potentially slower due to PCIe overhead. Prefer dedicated instances. OLLAMA_SCHED_SPREAD=0 (default) or ensure KV cache doesn't force spreading.	OLLAMA_SCHED_SPREAD environment variable.
  
Ollama GPU Utilization Details:
Ollama leverages NVIDIA GPUs for accelerated inference, provided CUDA and cuDNN are correctly installed on the Ubuntu 22.04 host and accessible within the Docker containers.   
Multiple Ollama Instances: To fully utilize both V100s for parallel request processing (e.g., handling multiple simultaneous users or concurrent internal tasks like LTM population), running two distinct Ollama Docker containers is the recommended approach. Each container will be pinned to a specific GPU using the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable. A load balancer (see Section 8.4) will then distribute incoming requests from the Python backend to these Ollama instances.   
OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL: This environment variable for each Ollama instance dictates the number of simultaneous requests that single instance can process by creating multiple context buffers (KV caches) for the single loaded model. The optimal setting is a balance between concurrency and available VRAM, calculated roughly as: (VRAM_GPU - VRAM_model_weights) > (num_ctx * OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL * VRAM_per_token_in_KV_cache). With approximately 10GB of VRAM remaining after loading a ~6GB 8B model, and a target num_ctx of 32k-64k, an OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL value of 2 to 4 per GPU instance should be achievable.   
GGUF Model Optimization: The use of appropriately quantized GGUF model files (e.g., Q5_K_M or Q4_K_M) is crucial for fitting the model into VRAM and achieving good inference speed. The V100's support for FP16 precision aligns well with GGUF's capabilities.   
Performance Expectations: Benchmarks for Ollama on V100 GPUs  show that 7B models (comparable in size to the recommended Llama 3.1 8B) can achieve around 107 tokens/second. This level of performance should provide a responsive experience for Jarvis.   
6.2. Database Performance Tuning
Optimizing the performance of ChromaDB and Neo4j is essential for fast LTM retrieval.

ChromaDB (Implicit Semantic LTM):
Indexing: Employ efficient indexing algorithms like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds), which is generally the default or a good choice for balancing search speed and build time for the expected scale of conversational LTM.   
Batch Operations: Utilize batch insertions when populating ChromaDB with new memories extracted from conversations to reduce overhead and improve write throughput.   
Metadata Filtering: Design queries to leverage metadata filters (user_id, session_id, language, memory_type) effectively. Applying these filters before or alongside vector similarity search can significantly narrow the search space and improve query latency.   
Data Preprocessing: Ensure consistency in the text being embedded. Normalizing text (e.g., lowercasing, removing irrelevant characters) before embedding can improve similarity matching.
Persistent Storage: Configure the ChromaDB Docker container to use a persistent Docker volume for its data directory (e.g., /chroma/chroma) to ensure data durability and avoid re-indexing on restart.   
Neo4j (Implicit Relational LTM):
Indexes and Constraints: Create indexes on node properties that are frequently used in query WHERE clauses or as starting points for traversals (e.g., User(userId), Entity(name), Session(sessionId)). Define unique constraints on properties that should be unique (e.g., userId for User nodes) to speed up lookups and ensure data integrity.   
Parameterized Queries: Ensure that all Cypher queries executed by the backend (especially those generated by LangChain or custom logic) are parameterized rather than embedding literal values directly into query strings. This allows Neo4j to cache query execution plans, significantly improving performance for repeated query patterns.   
Query Profiling and Optimization: For complex graph queries, use Neo4j's EXPLAIN and PROFILE Cypher clauses to analyze query execution plans and identify bottlenecks. This helps in refining queries or the graph model itself for better performance.   
Data Model Design: The efficiency of graph queries is heavily dependent on the data model. Avoid overly dense nodes (nodes with an excessive number of relationships) or overly complex relationship patterns if simpler alternatives exist. Model data in a way that reflects common query patterns.
Persistent Storage: Configure the Neo4j Docker container with persistent volumes for its data, logs, and configuration directories to ensure data persistence.   
6.3. Caching Strategies
Implementing caching at various levels of the Jarvis system can reduce redundant computations and improve overall responsiveness.

Embedding Caching: Embeddings for frequently accessed documents (e.g., from OpenWebUI Knowledge if repeatedly processed by the backend) or common query phrases can be cached. This cache, managed by the Python backend, could use an in-memory LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for simplicity or a dedicated caching service like Redis for distributed environments.   
Retrieved Results Caching: The results of queries to LTM stores (ChromaDB, Neo4j) and internet searches for frequently asked user questions or common information lookups can be cached.   
The cache key could be a hash of the normalized user query combined with relevant filter parameters (e.g., user_id, language).
Cache invalidation strategies are important, especially if the underlying LTM data or internet information changes frequently. Time-to-live (TTL) policies can be applied.
LLM Response Caching: For highly deterministic prompts that always yield the same factual answer (e.g., "What is the capital of France?"), the final LLM response itself could be cached. This is less applicable to dynamic conversational interactions but can be beneficial for repeated, purely informational queries.   
LangChain Caching: LangChain offers some built-in caching mechanisms for LLM calls and other components. These should be explored and enabled where appropriate.
The concept of Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG), where relevant knowledge is preloaded or aggressively cached, aligns with the LTM design and can significantly improve response times by reducing real-time retrieval needs.   
6.4. Considerations for Future Scalability
While the initial deployment targets a single server, the architecture should allow for future scaling:

Stateless Backend Service: The Python (FastAPI) backend should be designed to be stateless. All session state and persistent data should reside in the LTM databases or be passed with requests. This allows for horizontal scaling of backend instances behind a load balancer if user traffic increases.
Database Scalability:
ChromaDB: Scaling options for a self-hosted ChromaDB instance might involve migrating to a more distributed setup or considering Chroma's managed cloud offerings if extreme scale is needed.
Neo4j: For very large graphs and high query loads, Neo4j offers causal clustering, which provides horizontal read scaling and high availability. This is a more complex deployment than a single instance.
Load Balancing: As mentioned for Ollama, a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) can be introduced to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the Python backend service if it becomes a bottleneck.
Asynchronous Task Processing: Resource-intensive, non-real-time operations, particularly the automatic LTM population process (NLP extraction, summarization, embedding, database writes), must be handled asynchronously. This is critical for maintaining UI responsiveness. The user's interaction with Jarvis should not be blocked while LTM updates are processed. After Jarvis generates and sends its primary response, the relevant conversational data should be passed to a background task queue (e.g., Celery with RabbitMQ or Redis as a message broker). This task queue will then manage the execution of the LTM population pipeline. LangChain's callback system () can be utilized to trigger these asynchronous tasks upon completion of the main response generation chain (e.g., using on_chain_end or a custom callback). This ensures the user experiences fast interactions, while Jarvis's memory is updated shortly thereafter.   
7. Bilingual Capabilities and Language Handling
Jarvis is required to be an "advanced bilingual AI assistant with expertise in both English and Dutch," capable of automatically detecting and responding in the user's language with natural fluency.

7.1. LLM Prompting for Automatic Language Detection and Response
The primary mechanism for achieving bilingual interaction will be through careful prompt engineering within the Jarvis system prompt, embedded in the Ollama Modelfile.

Core Instruction: The system prompt explicitly states: "You automatically detect and respond in the language used by the user, maintaining natural fluency in both languages without unnecessary translation references." ([User Query]).
LLM Capability: Modern, large multilingual LLMs, such as the recommended Llama 3.1 or Qwen2.5, are generally adept at identifying the language of an incoming query and generating a response in the same language, especially when explicitly instructed to do so within their system prompt. These models are trained on vast multilingual corpora, enabling them to handle code-switching and language detection implicitly.   
7.2. Ensuring Natural Fluency and Idiomatic Language Switching
Achieving natural and idiomatic language use, particularly in Dutch, requires more than just basic translation.

LLM Selection: The choice of a base LLM with strong, high-quality training data in both English and Dutch is paramount. Llama 3.1 and Qwen2.5 are strong contenders due to their extensive multilingual training. While Dutch-specific models like Fietje  offer deep Dutch proficiency, a broadly trained multilingual model often provides better flexibility for nuanced bilingual interactions and general knowledge.   
Prompt Reinforcement: The Jarvis system prompt further reinforces these requirements:
"When responding in Dutch, use natural, idiomatic Dutch rather than direct translations from English."
"Adjust formality based on user's tone (casual "je/jij" vs. formal "u" in Dutch contexts)."
Continuous Evaluation: Rigorous testing with a diverse set of queries in both English and Dutch, including scenarios with mixed-language input, requests for idiomatic expressions, and varying levels of formality, will be essential to validate and refine Jarvis's bilingual performance.
7.3. Integration of Python Language Detection Libraries
While the LLM is the primary driver for language switching, integrating a dedicated Python language detection library in the backend can provide valuable supplementary capabilities.

Purpose:
LTM Metadata Tagging: To automatically tag each conversational turn (both user input and Jarvis's response) with its detected language (e.g., 'en', 'nl'). This metadata, stored in ChromaDB and Neo4j, is crucial for filtering LTM search results based on language, enabling more relevant context retrieval. For example, if a user asks a question in Dutch, the RAG system can prioritize retrieving LTM entries also in Dutch. This makes the bilingual aspect more deeply integrated than simply relying on the LLM's input/output switching.
Verification and Fallback: In cases of highly ambiguous or very short user inputs where the LLM might struggle with accurate language detection, the output from a dedicated library can serve as a verification signal or a fallback hint to the LLM.
Analytics: Logging language use can provide insights into user interaction patterns.
Candidate Libraries: Several robust Python libraries are available for language detection:
fastText: Developed by Facebook AI, it is known for its speed and accuracy, supporting 176 languages. Pre-trained models are readily available. Example usage involves loading the model and using model.predict(text) which returns language labels and confidence scores.   
lingua-py: This library is designed for high accuracy, especially with short texts and mixed-language inputs. It supports 75 languages and operates offline once models are downloaded. It also provides confidence scores. Example usage: detector.detect_language_of(text).   
langdetect: A port of Google's language-detection library, supporting 55 languages.   
langid.py: A standalone tool pre-trained on 97 languages, known for its simplicity.   
Selection and Implementation: For Jarvis, lingua-py or fastText are strong candidates due to their balance of accuracy (especially for shorter inputs common in chat), speed, and comprehensive language support. The Python backend will invoke the chosen library on each incoming user message and potentially on Jarvis's generated responses to log the language as metadata for the LTM. This logged language information will then be used by the RAG pipeline to filter or prioritize LTM retrieval, as described above, enhancing the relevance of context provided to the LLM.
8. System Architecture and Deployment
This section details the overall architecture of Jarvis, the roles of its constituent components, and the strategy for their deployment using Docker and Docker Compose on the specified HP Proliant G10 server.

8.1. Overall Component Diagram
The Jarvis system comprises several interconnected services, orchestrated to deliver its advanced AI capabilities. A high-level conceptual diagram would illustrate the following interactions:

User Interface: The user interacts with Jarvis through the OpenWebUI interface in a web browser.
Web Server (OpenWebUI): OpenWebUI serves the front-end application and communicates with the Python Backend for chat functionalities. It also manages its own "Knowledge" base (explicit LTM) using an internal ChromaDB instance.
Python Backend (FastAPI + LangChain): This is the central nervous system of Jarvis. It receives requests from OpenWebUI, orchestrates all AI logic using LangChain, and interacts with other services:
Ollama Instances (LLM Serving): The backend sends prompts to and receives responses from the Ollama instances running the Jarvis LLM.
Custom ChromaDB (Implicit Semantic LTM): The backend reads from and writes to this vector database for conversational memory.
Neo4j (Implicit Relational LTM): The backend reads from and writes to this graph database for relational conversational memory.
Tavily API (Internet Search): The backend makes calls to the Tavily API for real-time web searches.
LLM Serving (Ollama): Two Ollama instances, each pinned to one of the NVIDIA V100 GPUs, serve the core Jarvis LLM.
Databases: Dedicated Docker containers for the custom ChromaDB and Neo4j instances, providing persistent storage for implicit LTM.
Load Balancer (Optional but Recommended for Ollama): A lightweight load balancer (e.g., Nginx) can distribute requests from the Python backend to the two Ollama instances.
All these services will be containerized using Docker and managed via a Docker Compose configuration file.

8.2. Python Backend Service (FastAPI with LangChain)
The Python backend is the core orchestrator of Jarvis's intelligence.

Framework: FastAPI is chosen for its high performance, asynchronous capabilities (crucial for handling I/O-bound operations like API calls and database queries efficiently), and ease of developing robust APIs.
Core Logic with LangChain: LangChain will be extensively used to:
Implement the complete RAG pipeline (query analysis, multi-source retrieval, context aggregation, prompt formulation).
Manage interactions with the Ollama-served LLM.
Automate LTM population (NLP for extraction and summarization, data structuring, database writing).
Integrate and manage the internet search tool (Tavily).
Handle conversational history for context augmentation.
Optionally, integrate Python language detection libraries.
Key API Endpoints (Conceptual):
POST /api/v1/chat: This will be the primary endpoint for OpenWebUI to send user queries, chat history, and other relevant session information. It will return Jarvis's generated response, including any source citations.
Internal endpoints might be exposed for administrative tasks related to LTM, though the primary LTM population mechanism is designed to be automatic and asynchronous.
Asynchronous Operations: All potentially blocking operations (LLM calls, database queries, external API calls like Tavily) will be handled asynchronously using FastAPI's async/await features to ensure the backend can handle multiple requests concurrently without performance degradation.
8.3. Docker Containerization Strategy for All Components
Each component of the Jarvis system will be deployed as a Docker container, ensuring isolation, portability, and ease of management. The following table summarizes the Docker service configurations:

Service Name (in docker-compose.yml)	Docker Image	Key Environment Variables (Example)	Exposed Ports (Host:Container)	Mounted Volumes (Host Path:Container Path & Purpose)	Depends On

Ollama: Two instances are defined, each mapped to a specific V100 GPU via CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES. They listen on different host ports (e.g., 11434 and 11435) but the same container port 11434. Persistent volumes are mounted to store downloaded LLM models.
OpenWebUI: Uses the official image. Its data (including its internal knowledge base) is persisted. It's configured to connect to the Ollama instances, ideally through the ollama_lb load balancer.
ChromaDB (Custom LTM): Runs the official Chroma image, with data persisted in a volume. It exposes port 8000 (internally), which might be mapped to a different host port (e.g., 8001) to avoid conflict if the backend also uses 8000 on the host.
Neo4j (Custom LTM): Uses the official Neo4j image. Data, logs, and configuration are persisted. Standard Neo4j ports (7474 for HTTP, 7687 for Bolt) are exposed. Authentication is configured via environment variables. Other Neo4j configurations can be passed similarly.   
Python Backend (Jarvis Core Logic): Built from a custom Dockerfile. This container houses the FastAPI application and LangChain logic. It will require environment variables for API keys (Tavily), database connection strings (ChromaDB, Neo4j), and the URLs of the Ollama services.
Load Balancer (ollama_lb): An optional but recommended Nginx container can be configured to provide simple round-robin load balancing across ollama1:11434 and ollama2:11434. This simplifies the configuration for OpenWebUI and the Python backend, as they can point to a single Ollama endpoint. This addresses the need to distribute load effectively when multiple Ollama instances are used for parallelism.   
8.4. Docker Compose for Orchestration
A docker-compose.yml file will define and manage all the services, their configurations, networks, volumes, and dependencies.

Service Definitions: Each component listed above will have a service entry in the docker-compose.yml file.
Networking: Docker Compose automatically creates a default bridge network, allowing services to discover and communicate with each other using their service names as hostnames (e.g., the Python backend can connect to ChromaDB at http://chromadb-ltm:8000).   
Dependencies (depends_on): This directive will be used to control the startup order of services. For example, the python-backend service will depend_on chromadb-ltm, neo4j-ltm, ollama1, and ollama2 to ensure databases and LLM servers are available before the backend starts.
Volume Management: Named volumes or host-path mounts will be defined for persistent storage for each stateful service.
Environment Variables: Environment variables specific to each service (API keys, database URLs, Ollama configurations) will be passed through the environment section in docker-compose.yml or via an .env file.   
Example structures for Ollama and OpenWebUI in Docker Compose can be found in. The GenAI Stack project  offers a more comprehensive example that includes Neo4j and Ollama, providing a good reference. Full RAG stack examples on GitHub also demonstrate similar patterns.   
8.5. Persistent Storage Configuration
Data persistence is critical for Jarvis's LTM and operational state.

Ollama Models: A host directory (e.g., ./ollama_models_gpu0, ./ollama_models_gpu1) will be mounted into /root/.ollama (or the configured model path) inside each Ollama container. This ensures that downloaded LLMs are preserved across container restarts.
OpenWebUI Data: A volume (e.g., open_webui_data) will be mounted to /app/backend/data in the OpenWebUI container to persist its settings, user data, and the internal ChromaDB used for its "Knowledge" feature.   
Custom ChromaDB LTM Data: A volume (e.g., chroma_ltm_data) will be mounted to /chroma/chroma (default persistent path ) in the chromadb-ltm container.   
Neo4j LTM Data: Multiple volumes will be mounted for Neo4j:
neo4j_ltm_data/data to /data (graph data)
neo4j_ltm_data/logs to /logs (Neo4j logs)
neo4j_ltm_data/conf to /conf (Neo4j configuration files)
neo4j_ltm_data/plugins to /plugins (if any custom plugins are used) This follows standard Neo4j Docker deployment practices.   
8.6. Networking and Service Discovery within Docker Compose
Docker Compose simplifies inter-service communication.

Default Network: All services defined in the docker-compose.yml file are automatically part of a default bridge network.
Hostname Resolution: Within this network, services can resolve each other using their defined service names as hostnames. For example, the Python backend can connect to the Neo4j Bolt port using the URI bolt://neo4j-ltm:7687 and to ChromaDB using http://chromadb-ltm:8000 (or the mapped host port if accessing through host network). This is a standard feature of Docker Compose networking.   
Configuration for OpenWebUI: OpenWebUI's OLLAMA_BASE_URL (or equivalent if it uses OpenAI API conventions) will be set to the service name and port of the Ollama load balancer (e.g., http://ollama_lb:11430) or directly to one of the Ollama instances if a load balancer is not implemented initially.
Environment Variables for Connectivity: Connection strings and service URLs will be passed to containers (especially the Python backend) via environment variables defined in the docker-compose.yml file or an associated .env file.   
9. Data Flow and Component Interaction
This section outlines the sequence of operations for key Jarvis functionalities, illustrating how the various components interact.

9.1. User Query Processing Flow (from OpenWebUI to LLM and back)
User Input: The user types a query into the OpenWebUI interface and submits it.
Request to Backend: OpenWebUI sends the user's query, along with the current chat history and the identifier for the selected model (Jarvis), to a designated API endpoint on the Python Backend (e.g., POST /api/v1/chat).
Backend Orchestration (LangChain):
Language Detection: The backend first detects the language of the incoming user query (e.g., using lingua-py or fastText) to tag the interaction and potentially guide LTM retrieval.
RAG Pipeline Initiation: The LangChain-based RAG pipeline is invoked.
(Optional Query Rewriting): The user's query might be rephrased by an LLM call to optimize it for retrieval (e.g., adding context from recent turns, making it more specific).
LTM Retrieval (Parallel):
OpenWebUI Knowledge: If the query pertains to documents explicitly uploaded by the user, OpenWebUI's RAG system (or the backend, if it has direct access) retrieves relevant chunks.
Custom ChromaDB (Implicit Semantic LTM): A semantic search is performed for relevant past conversation summaries, facts, or user preferences, filtered by user_id and potentially language or memory_type.
Neo4j (Implicit Relational LTM): Cypher queries are executed to find related entities, historical context, or patterns relevant to the query.
Internet Search (Conditional): If the query is identified as factual and time-sensitive, or if LTM results are insufficient/outdated, the Tavily API is called for real-time web information.
Context Aggregation & Ranking: All retrieved information (from LTMs and internet) is aggregated, ranked by relevance, and de-duplicated.
Prompt Construction: A comprehensive prompt is assembled for the Jarvis LLM. This includes the original (or rephrased) user query, the aggregated and ranked context, relevant segments of the current chat history, and the core Jarvis system prompt (from the Modelfile).
LLM Invocation: The backend selects an available Ollama instance (e.g., via the ollama_lb load balancer) and sends the constructed prompt to the Ollama API.
LLM Processing (Ollama): The designated Ollama instance processes the prompt using the Jarvis LLM and generates a response.
Backend Post-processing:
The backend receives the raw response from Ollama.
It extracts the primary answer and identifies/formats any source citations as instructed by the prompt and LLM output structure.
Asynchronous LTM Population Trigger: The backend enqueues a task (e.g., using Celery) to process the current query-response pair and any extracted insights for storage in the LTM (ChromaDB and Neo4j). This happens in the background to avoid delaying the user's response.
Response to OpenWebUI: The backend sends the formatted response, including citations, back to OpenWebUI.
Display to User: OpenWebUI displays Jarvis's response and cited sources to the user.
9.2. LTM Read/Write Operations Flow
LTM Read Operations (Synchronous, during RAG):
The Python backend's RAG pipeline, triggered by a user query, identifies the need to access LTM.
ChromaDB Query: It generates an embedding for the query and performs a similarity search against the jarvis_implicit_ltm collection, applying metadata filters (e.g., user_id, session_id, language, memory_type) to refine results.
Neo4j Query: It executes Cypher queries (predefined or dynamically generated) against the neo4j-ltm graph to retrieve relevant nodes (entities, facts, past turns) and relationships.
The retrieved data from both databases is then used as context for the LLM.
LTM Write Operations (Asynchronous, post-response):
After the primary response is sent to the user, the Python backend (via a Celery worker or similar asynchronous task runner) receives the data from the completed conversational turn (user query, Jarvis response, detected language, session/user IDs).
NLP Processing: The turn data undergoes NLP analysis (NER, relation extraction, summarization) using LLM calls (via Ollama) or specialized NLP libraries.
Data Structuring for ChromaDB: Concise textual summaries or extracted facts are prepared. Metadata (user_id, session_id, timestamp, memory_type, language, source_turn_id, etc.) is associated.
Data Structuring for Neo4j: Extracted entities and relationships are mapped to the Neo4j graph schema (nodes with properties, relationships with properties).
Database Writes:
The prepared documents are embedded, and then written in batches to the ChromaDB jarvis_implicit_ltm collection.
The graph data (nodes and relationships) is written to Neo4j using batch Cypher MERGE or CREATE statements.
9.3. Internet Search and Verification Flow
Search Trigger: The backend's RAG pipeline determines that an internet search is required (based on query type, lack of LTM data, time-sensitivity, or explicit user request for verification).
API Call: The backend, using a LangChain tool, calls the Tavily API with an appropriate search query (derived from the user's question or a fact to be verified).
Result Reception: Tavily returns search results, typically including snippets, source URLs, and potentially a summarized answer or extracted content.
Verification/Summarization:
If verifying a specific fact from LTM, the backend compares the LTM fact with the internet search results.
If performing a general search for new information, the backend may use an LLM call (via Ollama) to summarize the content of the most relevant search result URLs or synthesize information from multiple snippets. LangChain's summarization chains are used here.   
Context Integration: The verified information, summarized content, and key source URLs (with access dates) are incorporated into the aggregated context that is passed to the Jarvis LLM for final response generation.
9.4. Sequence Diagrams for Key Use Cases
(Conceptual descriptions, as actual diagram generation is outside this scope)

Use Case 1: Standard User Query with LTM Retrieval:
User -> OpenWebUI: Submits query.
OpenWebUI -> PythonBackend (/chat): Sends query + history.
PythonBackend -> ChromaDB-LTM: Semantic query.
ChromaDB-LTM -> PythonBackend: Returns relevant semantic memories.
PythonBackend -> Neo4j-LTM: Relational query.
Neo4j-LTM -> PythonBackend: Returns relevant graph context.
PythonBackend -> Ollama (via LB): Sends prompt with query + LTM context.
Ollama -> PythonBackend: Returns LLM response.
PythonBackend -> OpenWebUI: Sends formatted response + citations.
OpenWebUI -> User: Displays response.
(Async) PythonBackend -> LTM Population Module: Sends turn data for background processing.
Use Case 2: User Query Requiring Internet Verification:
Follows Use Case 1 initially.
PythonBackend: Determines internet search needed (e.g., LTM result is outdated or query is time-sensitive).
PythonBackend -> TavilyAPI: Sends search query.
TavilyAPI -> PythonBackend: Returns search results.
PythonBackend -> Ollama (for summarization, optional): Sends search content for summarization.
Ollama -> PythonBackend: Returns summarized search context.
PythonBackend -> Ollama (via LB, for final answer): Sends prompt with query + LTM context + verified internet context.
Remaining steps similar to Use Case 1.
Use Case 3: Asynchronous LTM Population:
(After main response is sent to user in Use Case 1 or 2)
PythonBackend -> TaskQueue (e.g., Celery): Enqueues LTM processing task with conversation turn data.
TaskWorker -> PythonBackend (NLP/Summarization Module): Processes turn data.
PythonBackend (NLP/Summarization Module) -> Ollama: For NER, relation extraction, summarization.
Ollama -> PythonBackend (NLP/Summarization Module): Returns structured data/summary.
PythonBackend (LTM Population Module) -> ChromaDB-LTM: Writes semantic memories.
PythonBackend (LTM Population Module) -> Neo4j-LTM: Writes relational memories.
These flows illustrate the dynamic interactions between components to fulfill Jarvis's complex requirements.

10. Jarvis Persona Implementation and Operational Guidelines
The successful embodiment of the Jarvis persona and adherence to its specified operational guidelines are not solely dependent on the LLM but require a system-wide approach. The technical design must ensure these aspects are consistently enforced.

10.1. Ensuring Consistent Persona Across Interactions
Primary Driver - System Prompt: The comprehensive SYSTEM prompt embedded within the Ollama Modelfile (detailed in Section 2.4) is the foundational element for establishing Jarvis's personality ("helpful, friendly, and slightly witty"), tone, and core behavioral patterns. This prompt will continuously guide the LLM's response generation.   
Backend Logic Reinforcement: The Python backend, through its LangChain orchestration, will play a crucial role in reinforcing the persona. This involves ensuring that the operational rules defined in the prompt (e.g., "ALWAYS query knowledge base," "NEVER rely solely on training data") are translated into concrete actions within the RAG and internet search pipelines. For example, the backend will not allow the LLM to answer a factual query from its parametric memory if the LTM lookup step has been skipped or failed without appropriate notification.
Iterative Refinement: The effectiveness of the system prompt in maintaining the persona will be subject to ongoing review. Based on observed interactions and user feedback during testing and deployment, the prompt may need iterative refinement to fine-tune aspects of language, tone, or adherence to specific guidelines.
10.2. Implementing Core Capabilities (Technical, Creative, Practical Tasks)
Jarvis is expected to be proficient across a range of task types.

LLM's Inherent Abilities: The chosen base LLM (e.g., Llama 3.1 8B Instruct) possesses broad inherent capabilities for technical reasoning, creative text generation, and understanding practical tasks. The system prompt will guide the LLM on how to apply these abilities in the context of Jarvis.
Technical Questions: For technical queries (programming, system administration, etc.), the RAG pipeline is critical. It will provide specific, factual context from user-uploaded documentation (via OpenWebUI Knowledge), relevant past discussions (from LTM), or verified internet sources (e.g., official documentation, reputable technical blogs). The prompt also guides Jarvis to "include working examples, code snippets, or step-by-step instructions" where appropriate.
Creative Tasks: When presented with creative tasks (e.g., writing, brainstorming), the LLM's generative power will be leveraged. The RAG system might play a lesser role here, or provide inspirational context rather than factual grounding, depending on the nature of the creative request. The prompt "focus on originality and quality over length" will guide this.
Practical Assistance: For everyday tasks, planning, and productivity, Jarvis will focus on providing clear, actionable, and usable information, guided by the prompt "prioritize practicality and usability."
10.3. Handling Information Sourcing Requirements
The user query places strong emphasis on specific information sourcing protocols.

"ALWAYS query your connected knowledge base (vector and graph databases) before responding to factual questions.": The RAG pipeline, orchestrated by the Python backend, must enforce this as a non-negotiable first step for any query identified as factual.
"For time-sensitive information or recent events, ALWAYS check internet sources...": The backend logic must include triggers (keyword-based, topic-based, or recency checks of LTM data) to automatically invoke the internet search module for such queries.
"Never rely solely on your training data for factual responses that might change over time.": This is the fundamental principle underpinning the entire RAG + Internet Verification architecture. The system is designed to prioritize retrieved and verified external knowledge over the LLM's parametric memory for factual claims.
"Indicate when information comes from your knowledge base versus internet searches.": This will be implemented through the source citation mechanism detailed in Section 5.4. Citations will clearly distinguish between LTM sources (e.g., "Knowledge Base:", "Conversation History:") and internet sources (e.g., "Internet Search:, accessed").
"When providing factual information, include the source and recency of the data when available.": The citation mechanism will include source identifiers. Recency for LTM items can be inferred from their creation timestamp. For internet sources, the access date will be provided.
10.4. Response Formatting and Structuring
Jarvis's responses should be well-structured and easy to understand.

LLM Guidance via Prompt: The system prompt contains explicit instructions for response formatting: "Provide direct, actionable answers first, followed by necessary context or explanations," and "Structure complex responses with clear headings, bullet points, or numbered steps when appropriate."
Backend Post-processing (Minimal): While the LLM is expected to handle the majority of the formatting based on the prompt, the Python backend can perform minor post-processing if necessary (e.g., ensuring consistent Markdown for OpenWebUI display), but the goal is for the LLM to generate appropriately structured output directly.
10.5. Task Handling for Multi-Part and Creative Questions
Multi-Part Questions: The system prompt instructs Jarvis: "For multi-part questions, address each component systematically." The LLM should attempt to break down and answer each part. If initial responses are incomplete for very complex multi-part questions, the backend could potentially implement a strategy to iterate, breaking the original question into sub-questions and feeding them sequentially or in parallel to the LLM.
Creative Questions: The prompt "When presented with creative tasks, focus on originality and quality over length" guides the LLM. The temperature parameter in the Ollama Modelfile can be tuned (e.g., slightly higher for more creative outputs, lower for more factual ones, though a single setting will be used for the main Jarvis model).
10.6. Privacy, Safety, and Error Handling Mechanisms
Privacy:
Guideline Adherence: The prompt "Never fabricate personal information about the user" and "Do not store or expose sensitive user data" must be strictly followed.
LTM Population Safeguards: The asynchronous LTM population process (Section 3.5) should incorporate steps to identify and handle Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This might involve:
Using an LLM or NLP techniques to detect PII in conversational turns.
Anonymizing or generalizing sensitive details before they are stored in ChromaDB or Neo4j (e.g., replacing specific names with roles, redacting specific numbers).
Alternatively, simply not storing turns that are flagged as containing high levels of sensitive PII, or storing only very generic summaries.
OpenWebUI Access Control: OpenWebUI provides role-based access control for workspaces and resources like knowledge bases , which can help manage access to explicitly uploaded sensitive documents. However, this does not directly cover the implicitly generated LTM.   
Safety:
LLM Safety Training: The chosen base LLM (e.g., Llama 3.1) comes with its own safety training and filters designed to prevent the generation of harmful, illegal, or unethical content.   
Prompt Reinforcement: The Jarvis system prompt explicitly states: "Decline to assist with harmful, illegal, or unethical requests."
Additional Filtering (Optional): If necessary, an additional content filtering layer could be implemented in the Python backend to scan LLM outputs before they are sent to the user, though reliance on the base model's safety features and prompting is the first line of defense.
Error Handling (as per User Prompt):
Ambiguous Queries: "When faced with ambiguous queries, ask clarifying questions." This is primarily an LLM behavior, guided by the system prompt and its instruction-following capabilities.
Inability to Answer: "If unable to provide accurate information, clearly state limitations rather than guessing." Again, this is an LLM behavior driven by the prompt.
Knowledge Retrieval Failure: "When knowledge retrieval fails, explain the attempt and suggest how the user might reformulate their question." This requires coordination between the backend and the LLM. If the RAG pipeline returns no relevant context, or if an internet search fails, the backend should inform the LLM of this situation in the prompt, and the system prompt should guide the LLM to explain this to the user and offer suggestions.
Alternative Approaches: "Offer alternative approaches when original request cannot be fulfilled." (LLM behavior, guided by prompt).
Graceful Adaptation: "Adapt gracefully to unexpected inputs or unusual requests." (LLM behavior, guided by prompt).
11. Initial Setup and Developer Onboarding
This section provides guidance for developers to set up the Jarvis development environment and run the system for the first time.

11.1. Environment Setup
Prerequisites:
Docker Engine: Install Docker Engine on the Ubuntu 22.04 server.
Docker Compose: Install Docker Compose (usually included with Docker Desktop, or as a separate plugin for Docker Engine on Linux).
Git: For cloning the project repository.
NVIDIA Drivers, CUDA Toolkit, cuDNN: Ensure the appropriate NVIDIA drivers for the V100 GPUs are installed on the host system, along with a compatible CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN library version that Ollama and the chosen LLM framework require. These are essential for GPU acceleration.
Python (Optional): A local Python environment (e.g., 3.10+) might be useful for developers for direct API testing or client-side scripting, but is not strictly necessary to run the Dockerized system.
Repository: Clone the project repository containing all Dockerfiles, the docker-compose.yml file, Python backend application code, Ollama Modelfiles, and any other necessary configuration files.
Hardware Access: Confirm administrative access to the HP Proliant G10 server and verify that the NVIDIA V100 GPUs are correctly recognized by the operating system (nvidia-smi command).
11.2. Configuration
Environment File (.env):
A template file (e.g., .env.example) should be provided in the repository. Developers will need to copy this to .env and populate it with actual values.
Contents:
TAVILY_API_KEY: API key for Tavily Search.
NEO4J_PASSWORD: Password for the neo4j user in the Neo4j LTM database.
OPENWEBUI_SECRET_KEY: A random secret key for OpenWebUI session management.
Ollama URLs (if different from Docker Compose defaults, though service names are preferred).
Any other sensitive configuration parameters.
LLM Model Download:
The chosen GGUF model file for Jarvis (e.g., llama-3.1-8b-instruct.Q5_K_M.gguf) needs to be downloaded.
Place the GGUF file into the host directories that will be mounted as volumes into the Ollama containers (e.g., ./ollama_data_gpu0/models/ and ./ollama_data_gpu1/models/). Ollama looks for models in /root/.ollama/models by default within its container, so the volume mount should map to this structure, or the Modelfile FROM directive should point to the correct path if models are placed elsewhere within the mounted volume.
Alternatively, once the Ollama services are running, the model can be pulled using docker exec -it <ollama_container_name> ollama pull model_name:tag. The Modelfile will then reference this pulled model.
Ollama Modelfile: Ensure the Jarvis.Modelfile (as defined in Section 2.4) is correctly placed in a directory accessible for the ollama create command (e.g., within the Ollama model directory or a dedicated Modelfiles directory mounted into the containers).
11.3. Running the System
Navigate to Project Root: Open a terminal and change to the root directory of the cloned project repository (where docker-compose.yml is located).
Build Custom Images (if necessary): If changes have been made to the Python backend's Dockerfile or other custom Dockerfiles, rebuild the images:
Bash

docker-compose build
Start All Services: Launch all services defined in docker-compose.yml in detached mode:
Bash

docker-compose up -d
Create Ollama Model for Jarvis: Once the Ollama containers are running, create the Jarvis model using its Modelfile. This needs to be done for each Ollama instance if they don't share a common models volume where the created model manifest would reside.
Bash

docker exec -it ollama1 ollama create jarvis -f /path/to/Jarvis.Modelfile
docker exec -it ollama2 ollama create jarvis -f /path/to/Jarvis.Modelfile
(The /path/to/Jarvis.Modelfile should be the path inside the Ollama container where the Modelfile has been mounted or copied).
Access OpenWebUI: Open a web browser and navigate to the exposed port for OpenWebUI (e.g., http://<server_ip>:8080).
Initial OpenWebUI Setup: On first launch, OpenWebUI may require creating an admin account. Then, configure it to connect to the Ollama service(s) (e.g., pointing to the ollama_lb service if a load balancer is used, or one of the Ollama instances) and select/import the "jarvis" model.
11.4. Basic Testing Procedures
Verify Container Status: Check that all Docker containers are running without errors:
Bash

docker ps -a
Inspect Logs: Review the logs for each container, especially during startup, to catch any configuration issues or errors:
Bash

docker logs ollama1
docker logs python-backend
# etc. for each service
OpenWebUI Interaction:
Log in to OpenWebUI.
Select the "jarvis" model from the model list.
Basic Chat: Send simple queries in both English and Dutch to verify bilingual response and basic conversational ability.
Persona Check: Assess if the responses align with the defined Jarvis persona (helpful, witty).
LTM Functionality Test:
Engage in a short conversation, providing a piece of specific, non-trivial information (e.g., "My favorite color for project dashboards is dark blue").
In a subsequent turn, ask a question that implicitly requires recalling that information (e.g., "What color should we use for the new project dashboard?"). Verify if Jarvis recalls the preference.
Internet Search Test:
Ask a question about a very recent event or a piece of rapidly changing information (e.g., "What was the closing price of NVDA stock yesterday?" or "Summarize the top tech news from today").
Verify that Jarvis indicates it is searching the internet (or its response implies it).
Source Citation Test:
Ask a factual question that would require information from either an uploaded document (if one is added to OpenWebUI Knowledge and linked to Jarvis) or an internet search.
Check if the response includes citations to the source(s) used.
Database Verification (Advanced):
Using appropriate database client tools (e.g., a Python script for ChromaDB, Neo4j Browser or Cypher Shell for Neo4j), connect to the chromadb-ltm and neo4j-ltm databases.
After a few interactions with Jarvis, inspect the databases to see if new memories (documents in ChromaDB, nodes/relationships in Neo4j) are being populated by the asynchronous LTM mechanism. This may require querying based on user_id or session_id.
12. Future Considerations and Roadmap
While this document outlines a comprehensive design for the initial version of Jarvis, several avenues for future enhancement and development exist. These can further augment Jarvis's capabilities, intelligence, and adaptability.

12.1. Advanced Agentic Capabilities
Complex Tool Use and Planning: Explore more sophisticated agentic architectures within LangChain, enabling Jarvis to use a wider array of tools and develop multi-step plans to address complex user requests. This could involve tools for interacting with external APIs, performing calculations, or managing user calendars/tasks.
Proactive Assistance: Develop capabilities for Jarvis to proactively offer assistance or information based on learned user patterns, upcoming deadlines (if aware of them through LTM), or contextual cues, moving beyond purely reactive responses.
12.2. Proactive Memory Consolidation and Learning
Automated LTM Refinement: Implement background processes for more advanced LTM management:
Consolidation: Periodically review and consolidate related memories in ChromaDB (e.g., merging similar facts) and Neo4j (e.g., identifying higher-order relationships or summarizing interaction patterns).
Reinforcement Learning from Feedback: Incorporate explicit user feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down on responses) or implicit signals (e.g., task completion rates) to reinforce helpful memories and de-prioritize unhelpful ones. This creates a tighter continuous learning loop.   
Knowledge Decay/Forgetting: Implement mechanisms for gracefully "forgetting" or archiving outdated or irrelevant information from LTM to maintain its relevance and efficiency.
12.3. Broader Knowledge Domain Integration
Dynamic Knowledge Source Onboarding: Develop streamlined processes for integrating new, large-scale domain-specific knowledge bases into Jarvis's LTM. This could involve tools for batch ingesting and indexing documents into OpenWebUI Knowledge or directly into the custom LTM stores.
Federated Knowledge Access: Explore techniques for Jarvis to query and synthesize information from multiple, potentially distributed, knowledge sources beyond its immediate LTM.
12.4. Fine-tuning the Base LLM
Persona and Nuance Enhancement: If achieving specific nuances of the Jarvis persona, advanced idiomatic expressions in Dutch, or highly specialized domain understanding proves challenging through prompting and RAG alone, consider fine-tuning the chosen base LLM (e.g., Llama 3.1 8B Instruct).
Data Curation: This would involve creating a high-quality, curated dataset of ideal Jarvis interactions, Q&A pairs reflecting desired knowledge, and examples of persona-consistent dialogue. Fine-tuning is a significant undertaking requiring careful data preparation and computational resources.
12.5. Enhanced Evaluation Framework
Comprehensive Metrics: Develop and implement a rigorous evaluation framework to systematically assess Jarvis's performance across all key dimensions:
Bilingual fluency and accuracy (English and Dutch).
LTM recall precision and relevance.
Factual accuracy and effectiveness of internet verification.
Consistency in adhering to the Jarvis persona and operational guidelines.
Response speed and system throughput.
Automated Evaluation Tools: Adapt or utilize open-source evaluation tools like Ragas  for assessing RAG pipeline quality (e.g., context relevance, answer faithfulness, hallucination rates).   
Human Evaluation: Incorporate regular human review and rating of Jarvis's interactions to capture qualitative aspects of performance and user satisfaction.
13. Conclusion
This technical design document provides a comprehensive blueprint for the development of Jarvis, an advanced bilingual AI assistant. By integrating a carefully selected Large Language Model served by Ollama, a multi-faceted Long-Term Memory system leveraging OpenWebUI, ChromaDB, and Neo4j, and a robust internet verification engine, Jarvis is poised to meet its ambitious goals of high performance, extended context understanding, bilingual fluency, and verified accuracy.

The architecture emphasizes modularity and leverages the strengths of established frameworks like LangChain for orchestration and FastAPI for backend services, all deployed within a containerized Docker environment. Key design considerations include maximizing the LLM's context window on the given NVIDIA V100 hardware, ensuring efficient data retrieval from LTM stores, implementing asynchronous processes for LTM population to maintain responsiveness, and meticulously adhering to the specified Jarvis persona and operational guidelines through a combination of prompt engineering and backend logic.

The successful implementation of this design will yield an AI assistant capable of complex reasoning, nuanced interaction, and reliable information provision. The outlined future considerations provide a roadmap for continued evolution, potentially incorporating more advanced agentic behaviors, sophisticated memory management, and deeper domain expertise. Developers following this document should be equipped with the necessary technical specifications to build and deploy Jarvis effectively.
